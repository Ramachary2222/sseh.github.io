        <h1 class="about-title">About Simadri Surya Eye Hospital</h1>
        <p class="about-description">Simadri Surya Eye Hospital has been a beacon of excellence in eye care since its
            inception. Our mission is focusing on providing accessible and quality charitable eye care services to the
            13 primitive tribal communities and individuals in the Below Poverty Line (BPL) category. Additionally, we
            aim to offer affordable eye care to the general public in and around the areas of Nabarangpur, Koraput,
            Bhawanipatnam, Jagdalpur, and adjacent 11 districts of Odisha and Chhattisgarh.
            Founded and operated by the <strong>Susheela Public Charitable Trust</strong> and <strong>Simadri Misra
                Charitable Trust</strong>, our
            hospital embodies the vision of its benefactors to offer accessible, quality eye care to all segments of
            society.</p>

        <div class="sub-section">
            <h2 class="sub-title">Purpose and Establishment</h2>

            <p class="sub-description">The eye care facilities in Nabrangpur District are very minimal and restricted
                only for the primary level. The people living in and around this area has to travel to Bhubaneswar which
                is 250 kms far from this place for any emergency eye care and surgical intervention including specialty
                eye care treatment. As there are no surgical eye care facilities existing in this area and nearby
                districts the prevalence of Cataract induced avoidable blindness is still going high and there is no
                intervention for the past many years. Similarly, the emerging eye diseases like Glaucoma and Diabetic
                retinopathy are compounding the severity of the problem, which is neglected by the people in the
                villages due to lack of awareness and lack of accessibility of eye care services. Further, the childhood
                blindness in this area is also a burden due to lack of awareness and accessibility of services.
                Due to non-existence of any surgical centre in this area which is contributing to the need of reducing
                avoidable blindness and to provide affordable eye care services, the essentiality of the Secondary Level
                Centre which can provide quality and timely surgical care to the patients is of prime importance. To
                realize the dream of eliminating avoidable blindness, a full-fledged examination facility with NABH
                standards enabled operation theatre, trained manpower with availability of full-time ophthalmic Surgeon
                is essential.</p>
            <p class="sub-description">
                To address this, Simadri Misra Charitable Trust ( A
                Trust having long presence in Tribal areas of Odisha) and Susheela Public Charitable Trust ( people
                having successful management experience in operating eye hospitals in Rural and tribal areas) have
                joined forces to establish SIMADRI SURYA EYE HOSPITAL in Nabarangpur. This charitable eye hospital aims
                to treat poor and BPL category tribals free of cost (minimum 70% of total patients) and offers
                subsidized rates to those who can afford to pay for themselves.

            <h2 class="sub-title">Facility Overview</h2>

            <p class="sub-description">Situated in the heart of Nabarangpur town in an area measuring 66000 sq ft with a
                four storeyed building having 16000 sq ft area, one single story building of 3000 sq ft, and 1500 sf ft
                building for canteen, optical shop and chemist shop. In addition a 16 rooms guest house and
                accommodation for doctors,staff etc with 4500 sq ft area has also been constructed. The Hospital has 2
                nos latest state of the art Operation Theatres, 76 no patients beds, in addition to sufficient no of

            <h2 class="sub-title">Need of the Hospital</h2>

            <p class="sub-description">In India, particularly in Odisha's tribal regions, blindness and visual
                impairment, primarily caused by cataracts, pose significant public health challenges. Despite government
                efforts, including the Tribal Sub Plan, access to eye care remains limited, especially in remote areas
                where Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) reside. Among these, 13 PVTGs are recognized in
                Odisha, with six located near Nabarangpur, an area characterized by a high tribal population and a
                notable prevalence of cataract cases. The lack of medical facilities, coupled with the need for
                advanced, sterile environments for eye surgeries, exacerbates the issue.
            </p>
            <p class="sub-description">Simadri Surya Eye Hospital emerges as a critical facility in this context,
                offering state-of-the-art
                operation theatres and
                attracting skilled medical professionals by offering competitive wages, thereby addressing some of the
                acute healthcare needs of these marginalized communities.
            </p>
            <p class="sub-description">
                Despite these challenges, the establishment of this hospital in Nabrangpur stands as a testament to our
                commitment to bridging healthcare disparities.
                <img src="./images/map-of-odisha.png" alt="map-of-odisha" class="sub-image">
                The area covered in yellow line is our catchment area, where almost more than 50% are tribals.
                In rural Odisha, highest percentage of hospitalisation case was found in the age group 15-44 in Nuapada
                district with (78.5%) followed by Kalahandi (54.2%), Sambalpur (52.8%) and Sundargarh (52.8%).For 60+
                age group highest percentage of hospitalisation case was found in Khurda (54%),followed by Jharsuguda
                (47.8%) and Mayurbhanja (39.2%).
                Healthcare Scenario in Odisha:
                The national average ratio of doctor-to-population was estimated at 1:834, while in Odisha it stood at
                1: 2437. South Odisha is much worse.
